Chris Anver - simulation and control, wrote the MATLAB scripts and created corresponding Simulink models to conduct open and closed loop experiments to simulate and derive the transfer function and PI controller gains for the motor control, as well as writing the Arduino code to implement the PI controller for driving the motor.

Cole Binder - system integration, wrote the part of the python code that took the anlge that it found and wants the wheel to move to and sent it to the arduino, also wrote python code that displayed the angle on the LED, wrote the arduino code that read the desired angle sent

Quinn Ruddy - localization, wrote arduino code that interfaced with the motor to read its encoder, and powered the motor based on the value given by the control system, also did the wiring between the arduino and the motor that allowed them to interface properly

Colin Thompson - computer vision, write Python code to determine the angle of the tape in front of the robot
