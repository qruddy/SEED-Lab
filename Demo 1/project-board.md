Chris Anver - simulation and control, wrote the MATLAB scripts and created corresponding Simulink models to conduct open and closed loop experiments to simulate and derive the transfer function and PI controller gains for the motor control, as well as writing the Arduino code to implement the PI controller for driving the motor.

Cole Binder - system integration, built the chassis for the robot as well as prorperly attached the electronic components to it, and wrote the code that enabled the Pi to communicate with the LCD display

Quinn Ruddy - localization, wrote arduino code that interfaced with the motor to read its encoder, and powered the motor based on the value given by the control system, also did the wiring between the arduino and the motor that allowed them to interface properly

Colin Thompson - computer vision, wrote Python code to determine the angle of the tape in front of the robot
