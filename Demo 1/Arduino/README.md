Demo1.ino - basic code for the encoder readings and conversion as well as the velocity controller

FinalDemo1.ino - the final arduino code containing the functions that read from the encoders and change those readings to radians, as well as the control systems for the rotation and forward movement

rotations_experiment.ino - the code used to get readings on how the robot rotates, used to determine the transfer function for the rotation controller

vel_controller.ino - first iteration of the controllers

velocities_experiment.ino - the code used to get readings on how the robot moves forward, used to determine the transfer function for the velocity controller

velocity_controller_v1.ino - original arduino code for the velocity controller
