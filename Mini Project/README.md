Folder for SEED Lab Team 10 Motor Control Mini Project

angle.py - Python script that continuously takes pictures and outputs the angle in degrees depending on where a yellow marker is relative to the camera (Right = 0, Top = 90, Left = 180, Bottom = 270)

Mini Project Marker Detection.pdf - Document describing the marker detection scheme

ArduinoLocalization - Arduino code that controls the speed and the direction of the motor rotation using its built-in encoder. 

project-board.md - Document describing each team member and their role in the project

mini_arduino.ino - final, complete arduino code that reads data from the pi, reads the motor encoder, and rotates the wheel based on desired angle and control system
