angle.py - Python script that continuously takes pictures and outputs the angle in degrees depending on the color detected (R = 0, G = 90, B = 180, Y = 270)

angle1.py - Python script that continuously takes pictures and outputs the angle in degreees depending on where a yellow marker is relative to the camera (Right = 0, Top = 90, Left = 180, Bottom = 270)

Mini Project Marker Detection.pdf - Document describing the marker detection schemes

ArduinoLocalization - Arduino code that controls the speed and the direction of the motor rotation using its built-in encoder.
