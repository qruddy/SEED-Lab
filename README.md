# SEED-Lab
Repository for EENG350 SEED Lab Team 10

Contains documentation of projects completed by Team 10 for Systems Exploration, Engineering and Design.

Mini Project folder - contains documentation for the mini-project, in which an arduino controls the rotation of a wheel with a motor, using inputs from the motor's encoder and data given to it by a raspberry pi, which uses a camera to detect a marker, which indicates the angle to which the wheel should turn. The arduino contorl utilizes a PI contorller to complete this task and avoid overshoot.
